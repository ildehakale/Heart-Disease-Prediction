# Heart Disease Prediction
 
This project focuses on developing predictive models for heart disease detection using machine learning techniques. 
The study processes a dataset containing demographic, clinical, and diagnostic data to create accurate and efficient prediction systems. 
Techniques like feature selection, normalization, and advanced algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting are used to improve performance. 
By evaluating models on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, the research identifies the most effective approaches for early diagnosis, aiming to enhance clinical decision-making and reduce the burden of heart disease.
